#### Constants

There's one extension to regular binding: constants. Constats are names whose values can not be changed; they can only be bound once, and never re-bound. We can simulate constants in R using `lockBinding()`, or the infix `%<c-%` found in pryr:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 10
lockBinding("x", globalenv())
x <- 15
#> Error: cannot change value of locked binding for 'x'
rm(x)

x %<c-% 20
x <- 30
#> Error: cannot change value of locked binding for 'x'
rm(x)
```

`lockBinding()` is used to prevent you from modifying objects inside packages:

```{r, error = TRUE}
assign("mean", function(x) sum(x) / length(x), env = baseenv())
```
