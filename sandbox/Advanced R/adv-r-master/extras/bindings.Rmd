`<-` creates a binding in the current environment. There are three techniques to create a binding in another environment

*   Treat the environment like a list.

    ```{r}
    e <- new.env()
    e$a <- 1
    ```

*   Use `assign()`, which has three important arguments: the name, the value, 
    and the environment in which to create the binding.

    ```{r}
    e <- new.env()
    assign("a", 1, envir = e)
    ```

*   Evaluate `<-` inside the environment. (More on this in [evaluation](#nse).)

    ```{r}
    e <- new.env()

    eval(quote(a <- 1), e)
    # alternatively, you can use the helper function evalq
    # evalq(x, e) is exactly equivalent to eval(quote(x), e)
    evalq(a <- 1, e)
    ```

I generally prefer to use the first form because it is so compact. However, you'll see all three forms in R code in the wild.
