In the current development version of dplyr (which will eventually become dplyr 0.2) the behaviour differs between data frames and data tables:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

df <- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = c(1,2,NA,NA))
dt <- data.table(df)

df %.% group_by(a) %.% mutate(b = b[1])
dt %.% group_by(a) %.% mutate(b = b[1])
```

This happens because `group_by()` applied to a `data.table` automatically does `setkey()` on the assumption that the index will make future operations faster.
