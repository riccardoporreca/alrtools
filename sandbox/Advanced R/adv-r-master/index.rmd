# Welcome

This is the companion website for __"[Advanced R](http://amzn.com/1466586966?tag=devtools-20)"__, a book in Chapman & Hall's R Series. The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language.  It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R's quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side.
