% \section{First section}

Your text goes here.

Why is the first paragraph not indented?  
It is hard to tell.  
Maybe there is something wrong with the way this is setup.  
Personally, I do not like working with \LaTeX.

This is another paragraph.
It is nice that one can put seperate sentences on different lines in the \TeX code.
The typesetter knows that you only want a new paragraph when you put two carriage returns in a row.

More text.
