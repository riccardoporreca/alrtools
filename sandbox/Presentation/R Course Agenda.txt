Purpose
  The goal is that the attendees will know how to and have a motivation to start using R in their work at Beazley.  They will know where to get help both internally and from the R interface and community.
  
[5 Minutes]
Why use R?  Why not use Excel?
  1. Strenghts and Weaknesses of both
  ** 2. Include quote from Actuary Magazine about Spreadsheet Risk
  ** 3. Quotes from article Simon forwarded about Spreadsheet Risk
  4. R is a general purpose language ideally suited for dealing with data and doing calculations quickly.  There is a steep learning curve and thousands of functions.
  5. Excel is a general purpose computation engine with a slick graphical interface ideally suited for tactially moving and analyzing data.  My three year old can use it.
  6. Excel and VBA do not come equipped with complex data types
  7. Later in the presentation, I will show a couple of examples of where Excel fails and R excels.  Pardon the pun.
